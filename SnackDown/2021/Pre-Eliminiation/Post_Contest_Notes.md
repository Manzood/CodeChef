# Post-Contest notes:
Problem B:
    Misread problem B completely. Even upon re-reading, misunderstood it repeatedly.
    I didn't even give myself a chance at solving it correctly; wasted 2 hours of the contest in the process.

Problem A:
    For problem A, didn't trust the binary search solution, then proceded to code out a solution that was simply a guess, and had a chance at being wrong (but the binary search would not be).

Problem C:
    Didn't really attempt it, but it could have been solvable given enough time
